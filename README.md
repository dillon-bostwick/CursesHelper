# CursesWrangler
NCurses is a great way for C++ to play with TUIs, but there's a good reason why its called "curses." This library prevents you from being that reason.

Many novice C++ programmers want to easily build UIs but are often restricted to using the standard i/o stream to make a command line interface. The best they can aim for are little hacky tricks like carriage return, etc.

NCurses has a lot of potential but it is unbelievably messy. The API's learning curve is a nightmare and figuring out compatability issues as you go is no fun, especially considering the outdated documentation (I don't think I found any manuals online that have been written in the last decade).

My purpose is to allow programmeres new to C++ who want to actually focus on writing a simple graphical interface and not worry about the intricacies of NCurses.
